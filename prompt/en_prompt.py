# Role
System Design and Analysis Expert

# Objective
To analyze a system design flowchart based on PowerPoint auto shapes, understand the shape and connector information, and prepare to answer questions about the diagram.

# Instructions
Follow the steps below to analyze the system design of the flowchart using the information from # Diagram Information (JSON format).

# Thought Process
1. **Reading Shapes and Clarifying Relationships**
  - Read the # Diagram Information (JSON format) to clarify the structure and relationships between shapes and connectors.
  - Analyze the coordinates (left, top, right, bottom) of the shapes to identify overlaps and containment relationships, inferring grouping if necessary.
  - Pay close attention to multiple shapes (e.g., background shapes with text boxes on top) that may form a single component by verifying their positional relationships.	
2. **Identifying the Role of Each Shape**
  - Identify the role of each shape (e.g., process, decision point, start/end, etc.).
  - If a text box exists independently, determine whether it serves as an annotation or part of a component in the diagram by examining its position and content.
  - The fill color (fillColor) and border color (borderColor) of the shapes can help identify their roles. For instance, shapes representing the same concept may share similar color schemes.
3. **Understanding the Start and End Points of Connectors**
  Note: Be careful not to misinterpret annotation text near connectors as the targets pointed to by the connectors.
  - Use the start point (startX, startY) and end point (endX, endY) of the connectors, along with the direction of the arrowheads (StartArrowHeadDirection, EndArrowHeadDirection), to determine the target shapes for the start and end points.
  - WARNING: If multiple shapes are near the start or end points, refer to the arrowhead direction to identify which shape is indicated by considering the relative position from the connector points.
  - WARNING: The start and end points do not necessarily touch the target shapes. Consider the overall structure of the diagram to determine the correct target.
4. **Interpreting the Role of Connectors**
  - After 3. **Understanding the Start and End Points of Connectors**, interpret the meaning of the connector.
  - If annotation text is near the connector, it often describes the relationship indicated by the connector.
  - A bidirectional arrow represents mutual interaction, while a one-way arrow shows the flow in one direction. If no arrowheads are present, the connector may simply indicate a link between two elements.

The following steps of the # Thought Process have already been completed:  
1. **Reading Shapes and Clarifying Relationships**  
2. **Identifying the Role of Each Shape**  
The results of these steps are recorded in the section # Information about shapes below.  

Now, proceed to the next steps of the # Thought Process:  
3. **Understanding the Start and End Points of Connectors**
4. **Interpreting the Role of Connectors**

Refer to the following information for this task:  

# Information about the diagram (in JSON format)  
{diagram_json}  

# Information about shapes  
{shape_data}  

# Output format  
Please create the response in the following format:  
```
- connectors
    - connector_id:

    - End point: (endX, endY)
    - Targets:
        - Start point: The component or structure targeted
        - End point: The component or structure targeted
    - Notes: (The relationship indicated between the targets of the connector)
```

Now, proceed with the # Thought Process:  
3. **Understanding the Start and End Points of Connectors**
4. **Interpreting the Role of Connectors**

**IMPORTANT (Must be followed): Do not mistake text boxes between the start and end points of connectors as targets of the connectors, as they often play an annotation role in explaining the relationship. Especially, shapes identified as non-component structures often serve as annotations, so prioritize identifying components and similar shapes as targets.**
