Now, first identify what components are organized by SHAPE.
Some are grouped by multiple SHAPES and represent a single component.
There are also shapes (text boxes) that exist as annotations of connectors, etc.

Now you have identified from the information in the SHAPE what components are configured and what text boxes are present.

Now, continue by identifying what relationships exist from the CONNECTOR information.
